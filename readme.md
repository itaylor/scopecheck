### scopecheck

A flexible tool for finding global scope leaks (and more) via static analysis.
Built with [escope](https://www.npmjs.com/package/escope) and [esprima](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esprima)

### CLI Usage
    npm install -g scopecheck
    scopecheck "path/to/some/js/files/**.js"

scopecheck will scan the files for undefined references, (both usages and definitions) and give you a report about them

### myfile.js
    (function (){
        var foo = foo.bar();
        $('.someClass');
        x = 5;
        otherThing.that.is.not.defined();
    })();

### Command 
    #Runs scope check adding $ as an ok reference
    scopecheck -a "$" ./myfile.js

### Example output
    $ scopecheck -a "$" "tmp/myfile.js"
    Starting run with 1 files.
    tmp/myfile.js ðŸš«
      x 4:4
      otherThing.that.is.not.defined 5:4
    Files with errors: 1
    #exit with error code 1

### Options Reference:
    Usage: scopecheck [options] <fileglob>

      Options:

        -h, --help                       output usage information
        -V, --version                    output the version number
        -a, --add-predef-var [value]     adds a variable that should be considered as defined
        -r, --remove-predef-var [value]  remove this from the list of variables considered as defined
        -p, --print-predef-vars          Prints all the built-in variables that are considered as defined
        -e, --exclude [value]            A missing reference to exclude from the list of errors.
        -s, --suppress-non-errors        Suppress messages about each file processed.
        -n, --node-js-vars-only          Only add predefVars that are needed for nodes.js

      Examples:

        Find all missing refs in js files.  Allow that $ and jQuery are defined.
        $ scopecheck -a "$" -a jQuery "**/*.js"

        Find all missing refs in a single file, include debugger statements as errors
        $ scopecheck -r debugger foo/bar.js

        Report console statements as missing refs, except for console.error
        $ scopecheck -r console -e "console.error" "**/*.js"

### API Usage
  
Scopecheck can also be used programatically, and is rather flexible.
    var ScopeCheck = require('scopecheck');
    var sc = ScopeCheck();

    var output = sc
      .excludes(["$"])
      .reporter(ScopeCheck.reporters.cli)
      .run(["/path/to/file1.js", "/path/to/file2.js"])
